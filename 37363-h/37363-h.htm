<h2>THE HOLLOW TREE INN</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE THREE FRIENDS GO INTO BUSINESS</div>


<div class='cap'>ONE rainy day when the 'Coon and 'Possum
and Old Black Crow, who lived
together in three big hollow limbs of a
Big Hollow Tree, were rummaging about
their house, they found that above each
of their rooms was a good deal of room
that nobody ever used. That set them to
thinking, and pretty soon Mr. 'Possum said
it was too bad to let all that good room go
to waste, and Mr. 'Coon said yes, it was,
and that their house was big enough for a
hotel.</div>

<p>Of course he didn't think what he was
saying at the time, but it set Mr. Crow to
thinking and walking up and down, whistling,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and pretty soon he stopped still and
looked at the 'Coon and 'Possum.</p>

<p>"I'll do the cookin'," he said, "if you'll
get the things to cook."</p>

<p>And right then and there they made up
their minds to do it, and early the next
morning, while the Old Black Crow was
hurrying about inside, getting things ready
for business, the 'Coon and the 'Possum
nailed up a sign outside, and this is what was
on it:&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
THE HOLLOW TREE INN.<br />
BOARD BY THE DAY OR WEEK.<br />
</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 429px;">
<img src="images/gs02.png" width="429" height="600" alt="&quot;HELLO!&quot; HE SAID. &quot;WHAT&#39;S THIS?&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;HELLO!&quot; HE SAID. &quot;WHAT&#39;S THIS?&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Then they went inside to help Mr. Crow
get ready, and by and by they all sat down
and waited for people to come. Mr. 'Coon
and Mr. 'Possum felt pretty well, too, for
they thought they would have the easiest
time. You see, they had always depended
on Mr. Crow a good deal, for, besides being
a good cook, he was a great hand to provide,
and knew more about where to get the best
things, and the best time of day or night<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
to get them, than both of the others put
together. So he didn't say anything, but
dressed up nice and spruce in a clean apron
and cooking cap and leaned out of the window,
as cooks always do, with his arms
folded. By and by along came Mr. Jack
Rabbit.</p>

<p>"Hello!" he said. "What's this?"</p>

<p>Then he read the sign over and looked at
Mr. Crow and asked him if it was a joke.
And Mr. Crow said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not much! Come up and see."</p>

<p>So then Mr. Rabbit went up stairs, and
Mr. 'Coon and Mr. 'Possum showed him
through, and Jack Rabbit said that he didn't
feel very well this summer, anyway, and
he believed he'd just shut up his house and
come and board awhile for a change. He
said he guessed he'd take the room above
Mr. 'Coon's, because it had a nice south
window and a tall looking glass, and that
he'd pack up a few things that he needed
and come over right away. Then he went
home and the 'Coon and 'Possum and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Old Black Crow all shook hands and danced
around in a circle to think how well they
were going to do, for if Mr. Jack Rabbit came
they were sure of having as many others as
their house would hold.</p>

<p>And while they were dancing, along came
Mr. Robin. He read the sign, too, and
laughed, and then knocked at the door till
Mr. 'Coon came down and let him in. He
thought it was a joke at first, like the Rabbit,
but when he heard that Jack Rabbit
was coming to board he spoke up just as
quick as anything and said he'd come, too,
and that he'd have his things there before
supper time. He took the room over Mr.
Crow, because he said he didn't mind the
smell of the cooking, and then maybe he'd
learn some new receipts. You see, Mr. Crow
and Mr. Robin are sort of kinsfolk, and
when they have time they often get together
and trace back to find out just what relation
they are to each other, and that makes them
good friends.</p>

<p>Well, Mr. Robin hadn't more'n got out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of the house when who should walk in but
Mr. Squirrel.</p>

<p>"What's all this about boarders?" said
Mr. Squirrel. "I'm looking for a place to
spend a month or two myself."</p>

<p>So then they showed him the room above
Mr. 'Possum's, and he was so pleased with
the view and everything that he paid a week's
board in advance to be sure of keeping anybody
else from getting it. When he was
gone the 'Coon and 'Possum and the Old
Black Crow did another dance, and kept
saying over and over how rich they'd be
and what they would do with all the money.
Then they heard somebody laughing outside,
and when they looked out there was
Mr. Turtle laughing and reading the sign.</p>

<p>"Hello!" he said. "This isn't the first of
April."</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. Crow, "it's a boarding
house, and a good one. All the best people
in the country stop here. Mr. Rabbit, Mr.
Robin, and Mr. Squirrel. Sorry, Mr. Turtle,
but our rooms are all full."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Mr. Turtle did look cheap, for he
thought he couldn't be in the crowd, and
it was the very crowd he liked to associate
with. But just then Mr. 'Coon happened
to think that they might fit up the big room
below the other big room where they all
gathered to eat and talk, and Mr. Turtle
said that would suit him exactly, because he
was large and heavy and didn't care much
about climbing anyway. So he hurried off
after his things, too, and he wasn't out of
sight before here comes Mr. Dog!</p>

<p>Mr. 'Coon and Mr. 'Possum were both
looking out the window when he came up,
and they jumped back like lightning. You
see, they didn't like Mr. Dog worth a cent.
Then Mr. Crow came and looked out the
window and talked to him. Mr. Dog was
just as polite as a basket of chips, and of
course that's the politest thing in the world.</p>

<p>"I've just seen Mr. Robin," said Mr. Dog,
"and I came to get a room, too."</p>

<p>"Awfully sorry, Mr. Dog, but our rooms
are all full," said Mr. Crow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why don't you take down your sign,
then?" said Mr. Dog.</p>

<p>"Hotels never take down their signs," said
Mr. Crow.</p>

<p>"Hotels are never too full for one more,
either," said Mr. Dog. "If you don't let me
come in I think I'll wait around here and
make a vacancy."</p>

<h2>THE HOLLOW TREE INN<br />
(<i>Continued</i>)</h2>




<div class='chaptertitle'>WHAT HAPPENS TO MR. DOG</div>


<div class='cap'>NOW, when Mr. 'Possum and Mr. 'Coon
heard that their hair stood up straight,
for they knew very well that there'd be two
vacant rooms anyway if Mr. Dog ever got
inside, and two if he stayed where he was,
for they happened to think that Mr. Rabbit
would be coming along presently, and
Mr. Squirrel wouldn't be far behind. So
they hurried to the back window and looked
out, and sure enough, there was Mr. Rabbit
coming with his trunk on his shoulder and
almost there. At first they were frightened
'most to death for Mr. Rabbit, and then
the 'Coon slipped over and whispered to the
Crow to keep Mr. Dog talking as hard as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
could, so he wouldn't notice anything. All
the time he was doing this the 'Possum was
motioning to Jack Rabbit to slip up easy-like
with his trunk.</div>

<p>So Mr. Rabbit slipped up softly on the
other side of the house from Mr. Dog and
set his trunk down, and the 'Possum let out
a long rope with a hook on it. Jack Rabbit
stood up on his trunk and grabbed the hook
as soon as he could reach it and hooked it
under his arms. Then the 'Coon and the
'Possum pulled and pulled and up he came,
and as soon as he was safe they let down the
rope and caught the hook in the trunk
handle. That was a load for all three of
them, and even then they couldn't get it up,
and called across to the Crow to come quick
and help. So he had to leave Mr. Dog a
minute, and when he did that Mr. Dog
walked around the tree, and there was the
trunk just a few feet from the ground, going
up very slowly. That was enough for Mr.
Dog. He knew then he'd been fooled, and
he was so mad he didn't know what to do.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/gs03.png" width="500" height="502" alt="THERE WAS MR. RABBIT COMING WITH HIS TRUNK" title="" />
<span class="caption">THERE WAS MR. RABBIT COMING WITH HIS TRUNK</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>He took one look at that trunk and made
up his mind he wouldn't stand it. So he
stepped back a little and made a short run
and gave a jump for the trunk, just as high
as ever he could.</p>

<p>But Mr. Dog wasn't very lucky, for instead
of landing on the trunk he landed his nose
right against one corner of it, and that made
him madder than ever. He ran and jumped
again harder than before, but this time the
trunk was a little higher and Mr. Dog didn't
quite hit it. There was a strap hanging
down, though, and he caught it as he went
by. He caught it with his teeth, and two
of his teeth went right through two of the
holes where the buckle catches, and there
they stayed. He had the trunk all right
enough, but the trunk had him, too.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 389px;">
<img src="images/gs04.png" width="389" height="600" alt="AND UP HE CAME" title="" />
<span class="caption">AND UP HE CAME</span>
</div>

<p>There he was. His feet didn't quite touch
the ground, and he couldn't get up any higher
either. Then all at once the people up stairs
saw how it was, and they commenced to
laugh in spite of themselves, and hitched the
rope around a peg under the sill so they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
could rest a minute. That was fun for
them, but it wasn't for Mr. Dog, by a good
deal. He couldn't laugh, and he couldn't
rest, either. And just then Mr. Squirrel
came with his trunk, and Mr. Robin with his
satchel and a hand bag, and Mr. Turtle
with his things in a big sack. Mr. 'Coon
ran down and let them all in and locked the
door. Then he ran back to the window
where Mr. Dog was.</p>

<p>"If we'll let you down will you go home
and not come around this hotel interfering
with our business?" says Mr. 'Possum.</p>

<p>"Yes; will you promise not to try to get
any of our guests away from us?" says Mr.
'Coon.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 427px;">
<img src="images/gs05.png" width="427" height="550" alt="HE CAUGHT IT AS HE WENT BY" title="" />
<span class="caption">HE CAUGHT IT AS HE WENT BY</span>
</div>

<p>Mr. Dog couldn't talk much in the fix he
was in, but he did the best he could, and
promised yes to everything, so pretty soon
they let the trunk down till his feet touched
the ground and he could get his teeth out
of the strap. Then he put out for home just
about as fast as he could go, without so
much as thanking them for letting him down,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and up went Mr. Rabbit's trunk pretty
quick, now that there were plenty to help.</p>

<p>Then the guests all hurried to their rooms
to unpack, and Mr. Crow bustled around to
get supper with what he had in the house,
for Mr. 'Possum and Mr. 'Coon hadn't
time yet to bring in anything. It was a
pretty good supper, though, and all the
guests said so, and said they knew what a
good cook Mr. Crow was if he had things
to work with, and the Crow said he guessed
he could do his part if the 'Coon and 'Possum
would do theirs.</p>

<p>Well, it makes a good deal of difference
whether you're company at a house or a
boarder. They all felt a good deal like
company at first, but by the next evening at
supper time they felt different. Mr. 'Coon
and Mr. 'Possum had been out all day
bringing in things, too, and Mr. Crow had
been cooking harder than ever. Mr. Robin
was first to make remarks. He said the
cherries were canned, and not very good
at that.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 452px;">
<img src="images/gs06.png" width="452" height="600" alt="THE ARRIVAL OF THE OTHER GUESTS" title="" />
<span class="caption">THE ARRIVAL OF THE OTHER GUESTS</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's what I said," put in Mr. 'Coon,
"but Mr. 'Possum said you wouldn't know
the difference."</p>

<p>"Oh, he did, did he?" says Mr. Robin.
"Well, I've got better cherries than these
at home," and he got up from the table
with a disgusted air.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Squirrel picked up some roasted
nuts that the Crow had just brought in.</p>

<p>"Where'd you get these nuts?" he says,
after he'd cracked one or two of them.</p>

<p>"Down on the slope of Green Bushes,"
says Mr. 'Coon. "Why, aren't they good
ones?"</p>

<p>"I suppose they were once," says Mr.
Squirrel&mdash;"two or three years ago. Nuts
have to be fresh to be good."</p>

<p>"That's what I told him," says Mr. 'Possum,
"but he said you wouldn't know the
difference."</p>

<p>"Oh, he did, did he?" says Mr. Squirrel.
"Well, I've got better nuts than these at
home," and Mr. Squirrel <i>he</i> got up and left
the table.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Jack Rabbit began.</p>

<p>"Where'd you get this salad?" he says,
turning up his nose.</p>

<p>"Out by Mr. Man's back gate," says Mr.
'Possum. "Why, isn't it good?"</p>

<p>"Might have been once," says Mr. Rabbit.
"I s'pose it's some Mr. Man threw out because
it was wilted."</p>

<p>"That's what I told him," says Mr. 'Coon,
"but he said you wouldn't know the difference."</p>

<p>"Oh, he did, did he? Well, I've got better
salad than this at home," and Jack Rabbit
<i>he</i> got up and he left the table.</p>

<p>And then, pretty soon, Mr. Turtle made
a face over the fish because they were salt
mackerel and not nice fresh fish, such as he
was used to at home. So he got up and left
the table, too, and there sat the 'Coon and
'Possum and the Old Black Crow all by
themselves and looking cheap enough to fall
through the floor. Mr. Crow said it wasn't
his fault, and then Mr. 'Coon and Mr. 'Possum
commenced to blame it on each other,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and nearly got into a fight. They were
just about to fight when Mr. Crow happened
to think of something. Mr. Crow always
did think of things.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you!" he says. "We'll just rent
rooms."</p>

<p>"Do what?" says Mr. 'Possum and Mr.
'Coon together.</p>

<p>"Why, just rent each of our guests his
room and let him take his meals out. Then
we won't have any work."</p>

<p>"Whoop-ee!" says Mr. 'Possum and Mr.
'Coon both together, as loud as ever they
could. That made all the guests come running
back, and when they heard the new
plan they all said it was just the thing.</p>

<p>So then Mr. 'Possum went down and got
the sign and brought it up and changed it
to read:&mdash;</p>

<h2>A DEEP WOODS FISHING PARTY</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AN ADVENTURE WITH MR. DOG AND A VERY LARGE FISH</div>


<div class='cap'>ONE warm, still June morning (this, of
course, was before the Hollow Tree
Inn started) Mr. Jack Rabbit looked out of
the window while he was dressing and
thought to himself that it would be just
the very morning for fish to bite.</div>

<p>Jack Rabbit liked to fish better than anything,
almost, so right after breakfast he
took an empty tomato can and went out
in the back yard and turned over boards till
he had the can about half full of bait, with
a little dirt thrown on top. Then he reached
up under the eaves of the smoke-house and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
pulled out a long cane pole with a line and
hook and floater on it, all rigged up ready,
and flung it over his shoulder and started.</p>

<p>Mr. Rabbit walked pretty fast&mdash;even lazy
folks do that when they go fishing, and Mr.
Jack Rabbit wasn't lazy, by a good deal.
So pretty soon he came to the Hollow Tree,
and there, looking out of an up-stairs window,
he saw the 'Coon, the 'Possum, and the
Old Black Crow.</p>

<p>"Hello, up there!" he said. "Don't you
fellows want to go fishing?"</p>

<p>Mr. 'Possum said he thought fish would
bite well on such a morning, and that he'd
like to go first rate. Mr. 'Coon said he
knew a place where you could pull them out
as fast as you could throw in your hook, and
he went on and told how he caught a fish
there last year that would weigh more than
four pounds, and lost him just as he got
him to the top of the water. Mr. Crow said
he'd always noticed that Mr. 'Coon's four-pound
fish never got any nearer to him than
the top of the water, and that for his part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
he didn't care much about fishing. He said,
though, that if the 'Coon and the 'Possum
wanted to go he'd stay at home and get
dinner while they were gone, so's to have it
ready when they all came home hungry.
He told them that he had some nice canned
salmon in the cupboard that he could catch
'most any time, and that if they really wanted
fish for dinner he s'posed he might as well
open it. Then they all laughed, and in
about a minute down came Mr. 'Coon and
Mr. 'Possum with their fishing things. Jack
Rabbit said he had plenty of bait, so away
they went. Mr. Crow sat up in the window
and watched them off, and Mr. Robin,
who happened along just then, laughed and
called after them that he'd take a few
pounds of nice bass when they got home.
The Robin just said that to plague them, of
course, and Mr. 'Coon called back that
they'd fool him this time, and then he went
on to remark that he'd never in his life
seen a finer day for fishing.</p>

<p>Jack Rabbit said yes, that it was fine,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and that it was a fine day for Mr. Dog to
be out gallivanting over the country, too,
and that they'd better hurry up and get
to the lake and out in his boat before anything
happened. That made Mr. 'Possum
take a good deal livelier step, though he
commenced to whistle and said he wasn't
afraid of Mr. Dog, anyway. Mr. 'Coon said
he'd always noticed that a fellow mostly
whistled when he wasn't afraid, but for
his part he couldn't get to that boat any
too soon. And pretty soon they did get to
it, and Mr. 'Possum was the first one to
pile in, though Mr. Dog wasn't anywhere
in sight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/gs07.png" width="600" height="407" alt="WHEN THEY GOT OUT TO WHERE MR. &#39;COON SAID THE GOOD PLACE WAS, THEY ALL WENT TO FISHING" title="" />
<span class="caption">WHEN THEY GOT OUT TO WHERE MR. &#39;COON SAID THE GOOD PLACE WAS, THEY ALL WENT TO FISHING</span>
</div>

<p>Well, they pushed off, and Jack Rabbit
took one oar and Mr. 'Coon the other, while
the 'Possum sat on the back seat and baited
his hook so's to catch the first fish. Then,
when they got out to where Mr. 'Coon said
the good place was, they all went to fishing,
and Mr. 'Possum did get the first bite, but
he didn't get anything else when he pulled.
Mr. 'Coon told him he pulled too quick,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and Jack Rabbit told him he didn't pull
quick enough, and asked him if he expected
the fish to climb out on his pole. Then
Mr. Rabbit had a bite himself, and pulled
and didn't get anything, either. Of course,
that made Mr. 'Possum laugh, and then, all
at once, the 'Coon had a great big bite that
took his float away down out of sight the
first grab.</p>

<p>Mr. 'Coon let him go for a minute and
then gave a hard pull and commenced to
call out that he had him this time and that
he'd show Mr. Crow now about only getting
fish to the top of the water and having canned
salmon for dinner. Then he stood up in the
boat and pulled as hard as ever he could till
all of a sudden his line broke, and down he
went backward, right on top of Mr. 'Possum,
while the Rabbit swung his hook over where
the 'Coon's hook had been and the big
fish grabbed it before you could say Jack
Robinson.</p>

<p>That was too bad for the 'Coon and the
'Possum, of course, and it wasn't as much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
fun for Jack Rabbit as you might suppose,
for he couldn't get the big fish out to save
his life, and he had to hold on to the boat
to keep from being pulled into the lake.
Then he called to the others to help him, and
they both got up and took hold of the pole
and hauled it in hand over hand till they
got to the line, and that was as far as they
could get. So Mr. Rabbit gave the line a
twist or two around the iron ring in the front
of his boat, and the big fish started straight
for shore, dragging the boat and everybody in
it behind him, just as hard as ever he could
go. Then Mr. 'Coon and Jack Rabbit commenced
to quarrel about whose fish it was,
and Mr. 'Possum said he didn't care whose
it was, he was getting a free ride, and he
laid back and laughed and looked at the
shore, when all of a sudden he happened to
spy there, sitting on the end of a log, fishing
and waiting for them, nobody but Mr. Dog
himself.</p>

<p>That wasn't very much, of course, but it
was plenty for Mr. 'Possum. He quit laughing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and tumbled down in the bottom of the
boat and laid there calling for Jack Rabbit
to cut that fish line or they'd all be chops
and steaks and carried home in a basket in
less than five minutes. Jack Rabbit did
try to cut the line, too, but he was so excited
he dropped his knife overboard, and Mr.
'Coon couldn't find his, and Mr. 'Possum
didn't have any. So there they were, and
there was Mr. Dog! Then Mr. Rabbit tried
to bite the line off with his teeth, but he
couldn't do that, either, for it was a big,
strong line that he'd made himself, specially
for large fish.</p>

<p>And all the time they were getting closer
and closer to the shore, and Mr. Dog had
lifted his line out of the water so it wouldn't
be in his way, and was sitting there waiting,
and smiling to see them come.</p>

<p>Then Jack Rabbit knew that something
had to be done, and there was no time to
lose. He was just about as scared as he
could be, but he knew it wouldn't do any
good to let on, so he sat up straight and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
smiled some, too, and looked at Mr. Dog
and called out, big and friendly like:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hello, Mr. Dog! Here we come! Here
we come with a nice dinner, Mr. Dog!"</p>

<p>Then Mr. Dog laughed and called back:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's right, Mr. Rabbit. There's a sure
enough nice dinner coming this time! Fish
for the first course, Mr. Rabbit!"</p>

<p>When Mr. 'Possum heard that he began
to groan, and Jack Rabbit and Mr. 'Coon
began to shiver, for each thought he knew
pretty well what the next courses of Mr.
Dog's dinner would be. But Mr. Rabbit
didn't stop smiling or let on that he knew,
and he called out again to Mr. Dog, quick:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You'll have to help us if we have fish,
Mr. Dog! He's a big one and you'll have
to help us catch him!"</p>

<p>And Mr. Dog called back again:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Mr. Rabbit! I won't leave!
I'll be on hand when you get here, Mr.
Rabbit!"</p>

<p>Then he rolled up his trousers a little and
waded out into the shallow water, thinking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
he would nab Mr. Fish first and drag him
out on shore, and then pull the boat right
in after him.</p>

<p>Of course, that was a pretty good plan
for Mr. Dog, only like some other good plans,
it didn't work just as he expected it to.
You see, he didn't quite know how big the
fish was, nor how hard a big fish is to handle
in shallow water. He made a quick grab
at it when it got to him and then, right
away, he had his hands full of business. That
fish gave a flop with his tail that laid Mr.
Dog over on his back and then another flop
that set him on his feet again, and a side
flop that smacked him against the water
first one way and then the other, and made
him breathe hard and choke and try to let go.</p>

<p>But Mr. Dog couldn't let go, for he'd got
the fish line some way tangled in his teeth.
So he began to snap and paw and swallow
water, and fall down and get up again, and
sprawl about in the swamp grass, trying to
get back to shore.</p>

<span class="caption">THE FIGHT BETWEEN MR. DOG AND THE BIG FISH</span>
</div>

<p>And while all this was going on Jack Rabbit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and his friends had jumped out into the
shallow water and took a little roundin's to
shore, keeping out of Mr. Dog's way, and
made tracks for the top of a hill, where they
would be out of danger and see the fun at
the same time. Then they all stood up
there and watched the fight between Mr.
Dog and the big fish, and Jack Rabbit sang
out, as loud as ever he could:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't leave, Mr. Dog! Stay with him,
Mr. Dog! Hold him to it, Mr. Dog; you've
got him! First course, Mr. Dog!"</p>

<p>And Mr. Dog heard Jack Rabbit and got
madder and madder every minute, till all
of a sudden he got a lick on the side of the
head from Mr. Fish's tail that made him
see stars and broke the line. And away went
the big fish out into deep water, while Mr.
Dog crawled back to shore, wet and bruised
from head to foot, and 'most dead.</p>

<p>Then Mr. 'Coon and Mr. 'Possum and
Jack Rabbit, standing on top of the hill,
gave a great big laugh, all together, and Mr.
Rabbit called out:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"How did you like the first course, Mr.
Dog?"</p>

<p>That made them all laugh again, and then
Mr. 'Coon called out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you ready for the second course,
Mr. Dog?"</p>

<p>And pretty soon Mr. 'Possum he called
out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you ready for a nice roast now, Mr.
Dog?"</p>

<p>And that, of course, made them all laugh
very loud, for Mr. 'Possum used slang now
and then and meant by a "roast" that people
would all make fun of Mr. Dog wherever
he went; which they did, for a long time.</p>

<p>Even Mr. Robin, who was good friends
with Mr. Dog, couldn't help calling out to
him, now and then, as he went by:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you ready for the next course, Mr.
Dog?"</p>

<p>And Mr. Dog would pretend not to hear
and go hurrying by very fast, as if he were
out on special and important business for
Mr. Man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<h2>MR. RABBIT EXPLAINS</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AN EASTER STORY</div>


<div class='cap'>"WHY do we always have rabbits at
Easter?" asked the Little Lady.
"Is that a story, too?"</div>

<p>The Story Teller lit his pipe, thinking all
the time, and pretty soon he said: "Why,
yes, there is a story about that, and it goes
this way":&mdash;</p>

<p>One afternoon in the early spring Mr.
Jack Rabbit and his friends were out for an
airing. The Hollow Tree people were along,
and Mr. Turtle, as usual. By and by they
came to a log under a big tree and sat down
for a smoke and talk. They talked about
the weather at first and other things, till<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
somebody mentioned Easter. Then they all
had something to say about that.</p>

<p>"What I object to," says Mr. Rabbit,
when it came his time to talk, "is this thing
of people always saying that the Easter eggs
belong to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, but that's just a joke," says Mr.
'Coon, laughing.</p>

<p>"I know it's just a joke, of course, but it's
a pretty old joke, and I'm tired of it," says
Jack Rabbit.</p>

<p>"How did it get started anyway?" asked
Mr. 'Possum.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Rabbit took his pipe out of
his mouth and leaned forward a little, so he
could talk better.</p>

<p>"I tell you how it got started," he says,
"and after that I don't want to hear any
more of it. This is how it happened:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">THEY CAME TO A LOG UNDER A BIG TREE AND SAT DOWN FOR A SMOKE AND TALK</span>
</div>

<p>"Once upon a time, as much as twenty
grandmothers back, I should think, there
was a very nice family of Rabbits that lived
in a grassy place on a hillside back of a big
farmyard. There was quite a hole in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
ground there, and they had a cozy home in
it, and a soft bed for their little folk.</p>

<p>"Now, every bright morning, Father and
Mother Rabbit used to take the children out
for a walk, and for a few lessons in running
and hiding from Mr. Dog, who bothered
about a good deal, and one day as they were
coming home they heard a great cackling,
and when they got to their house there was
a nice fresh egg lying right in the children's
bed. Some old hen from the farmyard had
slipped in and laid it while they were gone.
A good many hens, especially old hens, like
to hide their nests that way, and this was
one of that kind.</p>

<p>"Well, of course all the young Rabbits
claimed it, and Mother Rabbit at last gave
it to the smallest and weakest one of the
children, a little girl, who was always painting
things with the juice of flower petals.
And the very first thing that little girl did
was to stain that egg all over with violet
juice, not thinking what trouble it was going
to cause our family forever after.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">THEY HAD A COZY HOME AND A SOFT BED FOR THEIR LITTLE FOLK</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was a nice blue egg when she got
through with it, and the next day, when
they all came back from their walk again
there was another white egg right by it.
The old hen had been there again and laid
another while they were gone. The second
little girl claimed that egg, of course, and
she painted it a bright yellow with buttercup
juice. Then the next day there was another
egg, and the next day there was another
egg, and the next day there was another egg,
until there was one apiece for every one of
the children, and some over.</p>

<p>"And they all painted them. Some
painted theirs pink or red with rose leaves
or japonica, some painted them yellow with
buttercups, and some blue or purple with
violets, as the first little girl had done. They
had so many at last that it crowded them out
of their bed and they had to sleep on the
floor.</p>

<p>"And then, one Sunday, and it must have
been Easter Sunday, they all went out walking
again, and when they came back every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
one of those beautiful colored eggs was gone.
The children cried and made a great fuss, but
it was no use. Some of Mr. Man's boys
out hunting hens' nests had found them and
taken them all home with them.</p>

<p>"And of course all those colored eggs set
Mr. Man to wondering, and he came with
his boys to the place where they had found
them; and when they looked in out jumped
the whole Rabbit family, helter skelter in
every direction.</p>

<p>"And right then," said Mr. Rabbit, leaning
over to light his pipe from Mr. 'Possum's,
"right then Mr. Man declared those colored
eggs were rabbit eggs, and he's kept on
saying so ever since, though he knows better,
and he knows I don't like it. He takes
eggs and colors them himself now, and makes
believe they're mine, and he puts my picture
all over things about Easter time. I suppose
he thinks I don't care, but I do, and I wish
that little Miss Rabbit twenty grandmothers
back had left that old hen's egg white as she
found it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's too bad," says Mr. Crow. "It's
like that story they tell about the fox making
me drop the cheese."</p>

<p>"Or like Mr. Man making believe that
the combs he uses are really made out of
my shell," says Mr. Turtle.</p>

<p>Mr. 'Coon and Mr. 'Possum shook their
heads. They had their troubles, too.</p>

<h2>THE HOLLOW TREE POETRY CLUB</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>HOW MR. DOG CAME TO A POETRY CLUB, AND WHAT HAPPENED</div>


<div class='cap'>ONCE upon a time, when it was getting
along toward fall in the Hollow Tree,
when Jack Rabbit and Mr. Robin and the
others had come to live with the 'Coon and
'Possum and the Old Black Crow, there
began to be long evenings, and the Hollow
Tree people used to think of new ways to
pass the time. They tried games at first,
and sleight-of-hand tricks. Then they tried
doing things, and Mr. Turtle carried them
all together twice around the big parlor
room on his back. But even that wasn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
so funny after the first evening, and Mr.
Crow, who did most of the thinking, had to
scratch his head and think pretty hard what
to do next.</div>

<p>All at once he happened to remember that
Jack Rabbit, who was the big man of the
party, was also a first rate poet, and liked
to read his own poetry better than anything.
So, when he thought of that, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'll tell you. We'll have a poetry club."</p>

<p>And of course that made Mr. Rabbit wake
up right away.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he said. "What kind of
a thing is a poetry club?"</p>

<p>"Why," said Mr. Crow, "it's a place
where the members each write a poem and
read it at the next meeting. You're the
only real, sure enough poet, of course, and
will be president, and write the best poem,
but the rest of us can try, and you can tell
us our mistakes. I've heard that Mr. Man
has clubs, and they're ever so much fun."</p>

<span class="caption">HAD TO SCRATCH HIS HEAD AND THINK PRETTY HARD</span>
</div>

<p>Jack Rabbit thought so, too, and all the
others liked the plan. So they elected Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Rabbit president and then went to work on
their poems. They couldn't have the first
meeting very soon, for it took longer to
write poems in those days than it does now,
so before they got half ready the news got
out some way, and even Mr. Dog had heard
of it.</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Dog! It made him really quite
ill to think he wasn't on very good terms with
the Hollow Tree people, for he thought he
could write pretty nice poetry, too, and he
wanted to belong to that club worse than
anything he could think of. He wanted to
so bad that at last he told Mr. Robin that if
they'd just let him come he'd promise anything
they asked.</p>

</div>

<p>They didn't want to let him, though,
until Mr. Crow, who always felt kind of
sorry for Mr. Dog, said he didn't see why
Mr. Dog shouldn't come and look in through
the window shutters, and that they could
nail a seat for him on a limb just outside.
They could pull him up to it with a rope and
he could sit there and listen and applaud the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
poems all through without being able to do
any damage to the poets, and he would be
glad enough to be let down by the time they
got done reciting.</p>

<p>So they sent him an invitation, and Mr.
Dog was as happy as a king. He went
right to work on his poem, and he worked
all night and walked up and down the yard
all day trying to think up rhymes for "joyful"
and "meeting," and a lot of other nice
words. Even when he was asleep he dreamed
about it, and said over some of the lines
out loud and jerked his paws about as if
he were reciting it and making motions.
You see, Mr. Dog hadn't always done just
right by the Hollow Tree people, and he was
anxious to make a good impression and fix
up things. He fixed himself all up, too,
when the night came for the meeting, and
took his poem under his arm and lit a cigar
that he'd borrowed of Mr. Man for the
occasion, and away he went.</p>

<p>The Hollow Tree people were on the look-out
for him and had the rope down and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
ready. So Mr. Dog tied it around under
his arms, and they pulled and pulled, and
up he came. Then, when he got pretty
close to the window, they closed the shutter
and put the rope through and pulled him
up still a little higher, so that he could
reach the seat on the limb, which was fixed
just right for him to sit there and lean on the
window sill while he listened and looked in.</p>

<p>Of course, Mr. Dog wished he was inside,
like the others, but he knew why he wasn't,
and he was glad enough to be there at all.
He peeked through the slats at the big room
and smiled and said some nice things about
how pretty the room looked, till they all
got real sociable with him. Then Jack Rabbit
called the meeting to order and made a
few remarks.</p>

<p>He said the duties of his office had kept
him from writing quite as long and as good
a poem as he would have liked to write,
but that he hoped they might be willing to
hear what he had done. Then they all
shouted, "Yes, yes!" and "Hear, hear!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and Mr. Rabbit bowed first to the ones inside
and then to Mr. Dog outside, and began:&mdash;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">In the merry days of spring,</span><br />
When the dew is on the meadow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And the duck is on the wing!</span><br />
For 'tis then, from Dan to Dover,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I'm a rover 'mid the clover,</span><br />
Seeking rhymes the country over<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With a ring, sing, swing&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With a ding, dong, ding,</span><br />

For I'm the rhyming rover of the spring.<br />
<br />
Oh, sweet the joys of poetry<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">In the pleasant summer time!</span><br />
For 'tis then I have no trouble<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To compose my gentle rhyme;</span><br />
In a nooklet by the brooklet<br />
I can think up quite a booklet,<br />
As with fishing line and hooklet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I assist the fish to climb</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To the music of my chime,</span><br />

For 'tis then my thoughts unfurling,<br />
While the smoke goes upward curling,<br />
Come a whirling, swirling, twirling,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With a rumty, tumty, tum,</span><br />
Come a twirling, swirling, whirling,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Like a rattle of a drum.</span><br />

<p>Well, when Mr. Rabbit got through everybody
sat still for a minute, till Mr. Dog called
out for somebody to come and unwind him
so he could get his breath again. Then they
all commenced to laugh and shout and
pound on the table. And Mr. Rabbit
coughed and looked pleased and said it was
easy enough to do when you knew how.</p>

<p>Then Mr. 'Possum, who was next on the
program, said he hoped they'd let him off
this time because he could only think of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
four lines, and that he was a better hand at
the dinner table than he was at poetry,
anyway. But they wouldn't do it, so he
got up and looked foolish and swallowed two
or three times before he could get started.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. 'Possum's poem was short, but it
went right to the spot, and the way they
applauded almost made Jack Rabbit jealous.
He said that it was 'most too true to be
good poetry, but that it was good for a first
effort, and that being short helped it. Then
Mr. Robin spoke his piece:&mdash;</p>

<p>The applause wasn't so loud after Mr.
Robin's poem, but they all said it was very
pretty, and Mr. 'Possum even wiped his
eyes with his handkerchief, because it made
him remember something sad. Mr. Rabbit
said that it ought to be "Mother and I,"
but that it didn't make much difference, he
supposed, about grammar, so long as it
rhymed and sounded nice. Then Mr. Crow
got up.</p>

<div class='poem'>
While others may sing of the pleasures of spring,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or winter or summer or fall,</span><br />
I'll sing not of these, because, if you please,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll sing of just nothing at all.</span><br />
Just nothing at all, because, oh, ho!<br />
I'll sing of myself, an old black crow.<br />
<br />
As black as a coal and as homely as sin&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What more can I tell you, I pray?</span><br />
For when you have nothing to sing of, why, then,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of course there is nothing to say.</span><br />
Nothing to say at all, oh, ho!<br />
Except good-by to the old black crow&mdash;<br />
The rollicking old black crow!<br />
</div>

<p>They made a good deal of fuss over Mr.
Crow's poem. They applauded, of course,
but they said it wasn't so at all, and that
Mr. Crow was a good deal more than "just
nothing." They said that it was he who
had got up this party, and that he was the
best man to plan and cook anywhere. Mr.
'Possum said he even liked Mr. Crow's
April fool chicken pies, and then they all
remembered and laughed, even to Mr. Crow
himself. After that it was Mr. Squirrel's
turn. Mr. Squirrel coughed twice and
straightened his vest before he began, so
they knew his poem wasn't to be funny.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'>THE FOOLISH LITTLE LAD<br />

<span class='smaller'>BY MR. GRAY SQUIRREL</span></div>

<div class='poem'>
Once on a time, the story goes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A silly squirrel lad</span><br />
One summer day did run away&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which made his ma feel bad.</span><br />
<br />
She hunted for him up and down<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And round and round she ran&mdash;</span><br />
Alas, that foolish squirrel boy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was caught by Mr. Man.</span><br />
<br />
For he had tried to climb a tree<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As Mr. Man came past.</span><br />
"I'll make you climb!" said Mr. Man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And walked home pretty fast.</span><br />
<br />
When he got there a boy came out<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As Mr. Man went in.</span><br />
That silly squirrel soon was put<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into a house of tin.</span><br />
<br />
"Now you can climb!" said Mr. Man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But when he did he found</span><br />
That nice tin house, so bright and new,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Turned round and round and round.</span><br />
<br />
And there he climbs and climbs all day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And never seems to stop,</span><br />
And I have heard my mother say<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He'll never reach the top.</span><br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>When Mr. Squirrel sat down there wasn't
a dry eye in the room, and even Mr. Dog outside
was affected. He said he'd seen that poor
little squirrel at Mr. Man's house turning
and turning away in his tin wheel, and felt
so sorry for him that two or three times he'd
tried to get him out. He said, though, that
Mr. Man had always caught him at it and
that then they didn't get on well for a day
or two. He was so tender hearted, though,
he said, that he couldn't help pitying the
little fellow, climbing and climbing all day
long and never getting anywhere. Mr. 'Possum
shivered, and said it reminded him of
bad dreams he'd had sometimes, when he'd
eaten too much supper, and dreamed of
climbing the rainbow. Then they all sat
still and waited for Mr. Turtle, who came
next.</p>

For it isn't so hard to remember the track<br />
To the house that you carry about on your back.<br />
</div>

<p>Well, of course, everybody applauded that,
and then it was Mr. 'Coon's time. Mr. 'Coon
said he was like Mr. 'Possum. He wasn't
much on poetry, and only had four lines.
He said they were some like Mr. 'Possum's
too.</p>

<p>That brought the house down, and the
Hollow Tree people thought the entertainment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
was over. They were going to have
supper right away, but Mr. Dog called out
to wait a minute. He said he had a little
poem himself that he wanted to read. So
out of politeness they all sat still, though
they didn't expect very much. Then Mr.
Dog unrolled his poem and leaned over close
to the blinds and commenced to read.</p>

<p>Before Mr. Dog was half through reading
the Hollow Tree people had gathered around
the window to listen. By the time he got
to the end of the third stanza he had to stop
for them to cheer, and when he read the
last one, Jack Rabbit pounded on the shutter
with his fist and shouted, "Hurrah for Mr.
Dog! Hurrah for Mr. Dog!" just as loud
as ever he could, while all the others crowded
up and shouted and tried to pound, too.</p>

<p>Well, maybe the shutter wasn't very
strong, or maybe they crowded and pounded
too hard in their excitement over Mr. Dog's
nice poem, for all at once there was a loud
crack and the shutter flew open and out
went Mr. Rabbit right smack into the arms
of Mr. Dog!</p>

<p>I tell you that was pretty sudden and Mr.
Rabbit was scared. So were all the others,
and they were going to grab the shutter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and close it again and leave Mr. Rabbit out
there. But Jack Rabbit thinks quick.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Dog," he said, "that was the
nicest poem I ever heard. Let me embrace
you, Mr. Dog, and be your friend for ever
after!"</p>

<p>Then he hugged Mr. Dog just as tight as
he could, and Mr. Dog hugged him, too, and
shed tears, he was that happy. He had
been wanting to make up with the forest
people for a long time, but he hadn't expected
this. Then the others all saw how
it was and they shouted, "Hurrah for Mr.
Dog!" again and invited him in. And Mr.
Dog went in and they had the biggest supper
and the biggest time that ever was known
in the Hollow Tree.</p>

<p>And that's how Mr. Dog got to be friends
with all the Hollow Tree people at last.
And he stayed friends with them ever and
ever so long&mdash;and longer&mdash;just as long as he
lived, for the Mr. Dog that isn't good friends
with them now isn't the same Mr. Dog.
And he isn't as smart, either, for he can't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
write poetry, and he's never even been able
to find the Hollow Tree where the 'Coon
and 'Possum and the Old Black Crow live
together and every summer keep open house
for their friends.</p>

<h2>MR. RABBIT'S UNWELCOME COMPANY</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MR. POLECAT MAKES A MORNING CALL AND MR. DOG DROPS IN</div>


<div class='cap'>I &nbsp;  THINK I shall have to tell you about
Mr. Polecat, said the Story Teller, and
about his visit to Mr. Rabbit.</div>

<p>"Who's Mr. Polecat?" said the Little
Lady. "You never told me about him
before."</p>

<p>Well, no, because you see Mr. Polecat is
so queer in some of his ways that people
even don't talk about him a great deal. He
is really quite a nice gentleman, though,
when he doesn't get excited. But when he
does he loses friends.</p>

<p>The trouble is with the sort of perfumery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
he uses when he gets excited, just as some
people use a smelling-bottle, and nobody
seems to like the sort Mr. Polecat uses except
himself. I suppose he must like it or
he wouldn't be so free with it. But other
people go away when he uses it&mdash;mostly in
the direction the wind's blowing from&mdash;and
in a hurry, as if they were afraid they'd miss
a train. Even Mr. Dog doesn't stop to argue
with Mr. Polecat. Nobody does, and all
the other Deep Woods people do their best
to make him happy and to keep him in a
good humor whenever he comes about, and
give him their nicest things to eat and a lot
to carry home with him, so he'll start just
as soon as possible.</p>

<p>But, more than anything, they try to keep
him from saying anything about Mr. Dog,
or hinting or even thinking about Mr. Dog,
for when he does any of these things he's
apt to get excited, and then sometimes he
opens up that perfume of his, and his friends
fall over each other to get out of reach.
They're never very happy to see him coming,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and they're always glad to see him go, even
when he's had a quiet visit and goes pretty
soon, which is just what didn't happen one
time when he came to call on Jack Rabbit,
and it's that time I'm going to tell about.
This was before Mr. Dog made up with the
Hollow Tree people; I don't know exactly
how long before, but a good while.</p>

<p>Mr. Rabbit looked out his door one morning
and there was Mr. Polecat, all dressed
up, coming to see him. He wasn't very far
off, either, and Mr. Rabbit hardly had time
to jerk down a crayon picture of Mr. Dog
that he'd made the day before, just for practice.
He pushed it under the bed quick,
and when Mr. Polecat came up he bowed
and smiled, and said what a nice day it was,
and that he'd bring a chair outside if Mr.
Polecat would like to sit there instead of
coming in where it wasn't so pleasant.</p>

<p>But Mr. Polecat said he guessed he'd
come in, as it was a little chilly and he didn't
feel very well anyway. So he came inside,
and Jack Rabbit gave him his best chair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and brought out a little table and put a
lot of nice things on it that Mr. Polecat likes,
and began right away to pack a basket for
him to take home.</p>

<p>But Mr. Polecat didn't seem to be in any
hurry to go. He ate some of the nice things,
and then leaned back to talk and smoke,
and told Mr. Rabbit all the news he'd heard
as he came along, and Mr. Rabbit got more
and more worried, for he knew that just
as likely as not Mr. Polecat had heard
something about Mr. Dog and would begin
to tell it pretty soon, and then no knowing
what would happen. So Jack Rabbit just
said "Yes" and "No" and began to talk
about Mr. Robin, because Mr. Robin was
a good friend of everybody and nobody
could get excited just talking about Mr.
Robin. But Mr. Polecat says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I saw Mr. Robin as I came along,
and he called to me that Mr. Dog&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then Jack Rabbit changed the subject
as quick as he could and spoke about Mr.
Squirrel, and Mr. Polecat says:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, did you hear how Mr. Squirrel went
over to Mr. Man's house and saw Mr. Dog
there&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then poor Mr. Rabbit had to think
quick and change the subject again to the
Hollow Tree people, and Mr. Polecat said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I stopped by that way as I
came along, and they called out to me from
up stairs how you were practising drawing,
and that you gave Mr. Dog some dancing
lessons the other day, and then made a fine
picture of him just as he looked when he
danced into the hot coals, so I hurried right
over here for just to see that picture."</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Rabbit! He didn't know what
to do. He knew right away that the Hollow
Tree people had told about the picture to
get rid of Mr. Polecat, and he made up his
mind that he'd get even with them some
day for getting him in such a fix. But
some day was a long ways off and Mr.
Polecat was right there under his nose, so
Mr. Rabbit said, just as quick as he could
say it, that the Hollow Tree people were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
always making jokes, and that the picture
was just as poor as it could be, and that he'd
be ashamed to show it to anybody, much
more to a talented gentleman like Mr. Polecat.
But that made Mr. Polecat all the more
anxious to see it, for he was sure Mr. Rabbit
was only modest, and pretty soon he
happened to spy the edge of the picture frame
under Mr. Rabbit's bed, and just reached
under and pulled it out, before Mr. Rabbit
could help himself.</p>

<p>Well, he picked up that picture and looked
at it a minute, and Jack Rabbit began to
back off toward the door and say a few
soothing words, when all at once Mr. Polecat
leaned back and commenced to laugh
and laugh at the funny picture Mr. Dog
made where Mr. Rabbit called to him,
"Dance! Mr. Dog; dance!" And then, of
course, Mr. Rabbit felt better, for if his
company thought it was funny and laughed
there wasn't so much danger.</p>

<p>"Why," said Mr. Polecat, "it's the best
thing I ever saw! You could almost imagine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
that Mr. Dog himself was right here, howling
and barking and dancing."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, hardly that," said Mr. Rabbit.
"Of course I suppose it is a little like him,
but it's not at all as if he were here, you
know&mdash;not at all&mdash;and he's ever so far off,
I'm sure, and won't come again for a long
time. You know, he's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it is!" declared Mr. Polecat.
"It's just as if he were right here. And I can
just hear him howl and bark, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>And right there Mr. Polecat stopped
and Mr. Rabbit stopped, and both of them
held their breath and listened, for sure
enough they did hear Mr. Dog howling and
barking and coming toward the house as
straight as he could come.</p>

<p>Jack Rabbit gave a jump right up in the
air, and hollered, "Run! Mr. Polecat, run!
and go the back way!" But Mr. Polecat
never runs from anybody&mdash;he doesn't have
to&mdash;he just opens up that perfume of his
and the other people do the running. So
Mr. Rabbit gave one more jump, and this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
time he jumped straight up the chimney,
and didn't stop till he got to the roof, where
he found a loose board and put it over the
chimney quick and sat down on it. Then
he called to Mr. Dog, who was coming
lickety split through the woods:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, how are you, Mr. Dog? Glad to
see you! Walk right in. There's company
down stairs; just make yourself at home till
I come down." You see there was no use
to stop him now, because Mr. Rabbit could
tell by what was coming up the chimney that
it was too late, and he wanted Mr. Dog to
get a good dose of it as well as himself.</p>

<p>And Mr. Dog did come just as hard as
he could tear, for the wind was blowing
toward the house and he couldn't detect anything
wrong until he gave a great big jump
into Mr. Rabbit's sitting room and right
into the midst of the most awful smell that
was ever turned loose in the Big Deep
Woods.</p>

<p>Well, it took Mr. Dog so suddenly that he
almost fainted away. Then he gave a howl,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
as if a wagon had run over his tail, and tumbled
out of that sitting room and set out
for home without once stopping to look behind
him. Then Mr. Rabbit laughed and
laughed, and called:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come back, Mr. Dog! Come back and
stay with us. Mr. Polecat's going to spend
a week with me. Come back and have a
good time."</p>

<p>But Mr. Dog didn't stop, and he didn't
seem to hear, and by and by Mr. Polecat
called up that he was going home and that
Mr. Rabbit could come down now, for Mr.
Dog was gone and wouldn't come back, he
guessed. But Mr. Rabbit said no, he didn't
feel very well yet, and guessed he'd stay
where he was for the present, and that if Mr.
Polecat was going he might leave both
doors open and let the wind draw through
the house, because he always liked to air his
house after Mr. Dog had been to see him.
Then Mr. Polecat took his basket and went,
and Jack Rabbit didn't come down for a
long time, and when he did he couldn't stay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
in his house for the awful smell. So he
went over to stay a week with the Hollow
Tree people, and his clothes didn't smell
nice, either, but they had to stand it, and
Mr. Rabbit said it served them right for
getting him into such a fix. It was over a
week before he could go back to his house
again, and even then it wasn't just as he
wanted it to be, and he aired it every day
for a long time.</p>

<p>But there was one thing that made him
laugh, and that was when he heard from Mr.
Robin how Mr. Dog got home and Mr. Man
wouldn't have him about the house or even
in the yard, but made him stay out in the
woods for as much as ten days, until he had
got rid of every bit of Mr. Polecat's nice
perfumery.</p>

<h2>MR. 'POSSUM EXPLAINS</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>HOW UNCLE SILAS TRIED TO PLEASE AUNT MELISSY</div>


<div class='cap'>WELL, you remember that the Hollow
Tree people took four of their friends
to live with them and called it the Hollow
Tree Inn. Mr. Robin came, and Mr. Turtle,
also Jack Rabbit and Mr. Squirrel, and
they made a jolly crowd after they got
settled and knew about each getting his own
things to eat, because the Hollow Tree people&mdash;the
'Coon and 'Possum and the Old
Black Crow&mdash;found they couldn't suit their
guests exactly when it came to a steady
diet. So they all kept house together, and
used to go out days (and nights, too, sometimes)
and get nice things. Then they'd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
bring them in and fix them to suit themselves,
and have them all on the big table
down stairs, nice and comfortable, where
they could sit and talk as long as they
pleased.</div>

<p>It was a good deal like a big family when
they were all together that way, and they
used to say how nice it was, and once Mr.
'Possum said he always did think a big
family was nice, anyway. Then Jack Rabbit
laughed and said he should think Mr.
'Possum was just the kind of a man for a
big family, being fond of good things to
eat and not very fond of getting them for
himself, and mostly fat and sleepy like. He
said if there was just a nice, spry Mrs.
'Possum, now, to keep house and look after
things he should think it would be ever so
much better than living in bachelor quarters,
or, rather, thirds, with Mr. 'Coon and Mr.
Crow, and not having things very orderly.
Of course, with himself, Jack Rabbit said,
it was different, but even at his house it got
lonesome, too, now and then.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 575px;">
<img src="images/gs20.png" width="575" height="450" alt="SHE TIED HIS TIE FOR HIM" title="" />
<span class="caption">SHE TIED HIS TIE FOR HIM</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, Mr. 'Possum thought a minute, and
then he said that there was such a thing as
folks being too spry, and that it was because
he had always been afraid of getting that
kind that he had been pretty well satisfied
to live in the Hollow Tree just as he was.
He said that he had once had an uncle that
something happened to in that line, and
whenever he thought about poor Uncle Lovejoy
he didn't seem to care much about
trying anything he wasn't used to. Then
they all wanted him to tell about Uncle
Lovejoy and what happened to him. So
Mr. 'Possum did tell, and it went this way:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Once upon a time," he said, "Uncle
Lovejoy&mdash;we always called him Uncle Silas
then&mdash;he was uncle on my mother's side,
and lived with Aunt Melissy in a nice place
just beyond the Wide Paw-paw Hollows&mdash;once
upon a time, as I was saying, he had
to go to town on some business, and that was
something that never happened to Uncle
Lovejoy before.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/gs21.png" width="500" height="357" alt="COUSIN GLENWOOD MET HIM AT THE STATION" title="" />
<span class="caption">COUSIN GLENWOOD MET HIM AT THE STATION</span>
</div>

<p>"Well, Aunt Melissy was always a spry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
woman, as I said, and stirring&mdash;very stirring,
and primpy, too. But she was never as
stirring and spry and primpy as she was
the day that Uncle Silas started for town.
She dressed him all up neat and proper in
his very best things, and tied his tie for
him, and while she was tying it she says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 575px;">
<img src="images/gs22.png" width="575" height="432" alt="COUSIN GLEN TOOK UNCLE LOVEJOY TO THE STORES" title="" />
<span class="caption">COUSIN GLEN TOOK UNCLE LOVEJOY TO THE STORES</span>
</div>

<p>"'Now, Silas,' she says, 'when you get to
town you buy a few little articles right away
and put them on. You don't want folks to
see that you come from the country, you
know, and you don't want Cousin Glenwood
to be ashamed of you before folks. Cousin
Glen will know just what things you need
and where to get them.' Then she told him
not to get run over by anything, or blow
out the gas, or let anybody see that he
wasn't used to things, because, you see,
Aunt Melissy was proud, being a Glenwood
herself. Then Uncle Lovejoy promised all
those things, and that he would use his napkin
and not eat pie out of his hand or drink
out of his finger bowl, and a lot more things
that Aunt Melissy remembered at the last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
minute. So you see by the time he got on
the train he had a good deal to think about,
and he kept thinking about it until by the
time he got to the city he'd made up his
mind he'd try to do for once everything
she told him to and give her a pleasant
surprise with the way he had fixed up and
improved his manners when he got back.
Uncle Lovejoy was good natured, and always
anxious to please folks, especially Aunt
Melissy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/gs23.png" width="600" height="392" alt="WHERE THERE WAS A MIRROR UNCLE LOVEJOY WOULD STAND BEFORE IT AND ADMIRE HIMSELF" title="" />
<span class="caption">WHERE THERE WAS A MIRROR UNCLE LOVEJOY WOULD STAND BEFORE IT AND ADMIRE HIMSELF</span>
</div>

<p>"Well, Cousin Glenwood met him at the
station, and about the first thing Uncle Silas
said was to ask him where he got his clothes,
and to tell him that Aunt Melissy had said
he was to fix up, so's folks wouldn't think
he came from the country, which, of course,
she had. That just suited Cousin Glenwood,
for he liked to spend money and
show off what he knew about the city; so
he took Uncle Lovejoy 'most everywhere,
and told him to buy 'most everything he
saw. And of course Uncle Silas did it, because
he wanted to surprise Aunt Melissy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
when he got back, and make her feel happy
for once in her life.</p>

<p>"Cousin Glen took Uncle Lovejoy to the
stores first, and then to a good many different
kinds of places afterward, and every
place where there was a mirror Uncle Lovejoy
would stand before it and admire himself
and wonder what Aunt Melissy would say
when he got home. He kept buying new
things every day, because every day he'd
see somebody with something on or carrying
or leading something, and when he remembered
what Aunt Melissy said, he made
up his mind he'd have to have all the things
to please her, and he got them as far as he
could. Even Cousin Glenwood had to commence
buying things pretty soon to keep
up, and before long people used to stop on
the street and look at them when they went
by. Uncle Silas didn't want to go home,
either, when the time came, but of course
he had to, and he put on his best clothes
for the trip, and took a young man he'd
hired to wait on him, and started.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 575px;">
<img src="images/gs24.png" width="575" height="430" alt="PEOPLE USED TO STOP ON THE STREET AND LOOK AT THEM" title="" />
<span class="caption">PEOPLE USED TO STOP ON THE STREET AND LOOK AT THEM</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"He didn't tell Aunt Melissy just what
time he'd be there, so it was a surprise sure
enough. He walked right into the yard, and
behind was the young man he'd hired, carrying
his things. Aunt Melissy was getting
dinner, and had just come to the door a
minute to see what time it was by the sun,
when all of a sudden, as she looked up, there
he was! He had his hat in one hand and a
cane in the other, and was leading a game
chicken by a string. All his boxes and bundles
and the young man were behind him.
Uncle Lovejoy wore an eyeglass, too, and
smoked a paper thing he said was a cigarette.
My little cousins, who were there, told me
afterward that their pa had never looked so
fine in his life before or since. They didn't
know him at all, and neither did Aunt
Melissy. She thought he was somebody with
something to sell at first, and when he said,
'Aw, there, Melissah!' she threw up her
hands and was about to call for help, when
just that minute she saw it was Uncle Silas.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/gs25.png" width="500" height="324" alt="HE WALKED RIGHT INTO THE YARD, AND BEHIND WAS THE YOUNG MAN HE&#39;D HIRED" title="" />
<span class="caption">HE WALKED RIGHT INTO THE YARD, AND BEHIND WAS THE YOUNG MAN HE&#39;D HIRED</span>
</div>

<p>"Poor Uncle Silas! He meant to surprise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
her, and he did it sure enough. He meant
to please her, though, and he didn't do that
worth a cent. It seemed funny, but she
was mad. That's just the trouble about
women folks; you never know when you're
going to please them. My little cousins said
they never saw their ma so mad before or
since. She made Uncle Lovejoy take off
all his nice clothes, and the young man, too,
and she cooked the game chicken for dinner.
Then, right after dinner, she picked up a
bag of shinney sticks that Uncle Lovejoy
had brought home, and she says to him and
the young man:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/gs26.png" width="600" height="348" alt="&quot;NOW YOU GET OUT IN THE GARDEN, BOTH OF YOU&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;NOW YOU GET OUT IN THE GARDEN, BOTH OF YOU&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"'Now you get out in the garden,' she
says, 'both of you, and try to earn back
some of this money you've been spending.'
And Uncle Lovejoy didn't feel very much
like it, but he went, and so did the young
man. So did Aunt Melissy, and she used
up most of those shinney sticks on Uncle
Silas and the young man before fall, and
Uncle Silas never saw any of his nice clothes
again, though they had the best garden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
they ever did have, so my little cousins
said.</p>

<p>"And that," said Mr. 'Possum, leaning
back in his chair to smoke, "that's why I've
always been afraid to try family life. It's
easier to please one than two, especially
when the other one is a spry, stirring person
like Aunt Melissy Lovejoy."</p>

<p>"What became of all the good clothes?"
asked Jack Rabbit, who was always very
stylish.</p>

<p>"Why, I've heard," said Mr. 'Possum,
"that Aunt Melissy made some of them over
for my little cousins, and that she traded
off the rest of them to a pedler for patent
medicine to give Uncle Silas for a weak
mind, and I think he needed it some myself
for trying to please her in the first place."</p>

<p>Mr. Rabbit nodded.</p>

<p>"It takes all kinds of people to make a
world," he said.</p>

<p>Mr. 'Coon yawned and rubbed his eyes.
The others were fast asleep.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>
<h2>AROUND THE WORLD AND BACK AGAIN</h2>


<div class="cap">ONCE upon a time, when Mr. Dog was
over spending the evening with the
Hollow Tree people, he told them that Mr.
Man had said the world was round, like a
ball. Of course this was after Mr. Dog got
to be good friends with the 'Possum and the
'Coon and the Old Black Crow, and he
often used to come over to the Hollow Tree,
where they lived, for a quiet talk and smoke,
and to tell the things that Mr. Man said
and did, and what he had on his table for
dinner.</div>

<p>The Hollow Tree people liked to hear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
about Mr. Man, too; but when they heard
what he said about the world being round
they thought there must be some mistake
in the way Mr. Dog had understood it.
Mr. 'Coon said that it couldn't be so, for
the edge of the world was just beyond the
last trees of the Big Deep Woods, and that
he'd often sat there and hung his feet over
and watched the moon come up. Mr. 'Possum
said so, too; and Mr. Crow said that
the other edge was over along the Wide
Blue Water, where Mr. Turtle lived, and that
of course the water was flat, as everybody
could see. Anyway, it would spill out if it
wasn't.</p>

<p>But Mr. Dog stuck to it that Mr. Man
had said just what Mr. Dog had said he said,
and that, what was more, Mr. Man had
said that the world turned over every day,
and that the sun and moon and stars all
went round it. And Mr. Man had said, too,
that people sometimes went around the
world, and didn't turn over or fall off into
the sky when they were underneath, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
kept on, and came up on the other side,
right back to the very place they started
from.</p>

<p>Well, that made them all wonder a good
deal more than ever; and Mr. Jack Rabbit,
who came in just then for the evening, said
he shouldn't be a bit surprised if it were
true, for he'd often noticed how the seasons
went round and round, and he thought, now,
they must travel around the world some
way, too. He said he'd composed some
poetry on Spring as he came along, and that
now he understood some lines of it better
than he had at the start; for, of course,
when poetry just comes to anybody, as it
does to Mr. Rabbit, it isn't expected that
even the poet himself will understand it
very well at first.</p>

<p>Then they all wanted to hear Jack
Rabbit's poem, and Mr. Rabbit said
that it really wasn't just as he wanted it
yet, but that if they wouldn't expect too
much, he'd let them hear how it went,
anyway.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'>WHICH WAY, SPRING?<br />

<span class='smaller'>BY J. RABBIT</span></div>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">O Spring,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Ho, Spring!</span><br />
Whither do you go, Spring?<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I would go there, too.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Pray, Spring,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Say, Spring,</span><br />
Whither and away, Spring?<br />
I would start to-day, Spring,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If I go with you.</span><br />
</div>

<p>And Spring answers:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Why, sir,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">I, sir,</span><br />
Just go tripping by, sir&mdash;<br />
If you did but try, sir,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You could go with me.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Follow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Follow,</span><br />
Over hill and hollow&mdash;<br />
Where the bluebirds call, O,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am sure to be.</span><br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, everybody applauded that, of course;
and Mr. 'Coon said that for his part he was
tired of cold weather, and that if to-morrow
was a bright day, and anybody'd go with
him, he'd start out at sunrise and follow
Spring clear around the world. Then Mr.
'Possum said he'd go just to see whether Mr.
Man was right or not, and Mr. Crow said
he'd go, too. Mr. Rabbit wanted to go to
prove some things in his poem, but he had
to make a garden if it was a good day, and
Mr. Dog had an engagement to dig moles
for Mr. Man.</p>

<p>So the next morning, bright and early,
the three Hollow Tree people got up and
started. They packed some lunch in a basket,
so they wouldn't get hungry, in case
they were gone all day, and set out in high
spirits; for it was a beautiful morning in
April, and they knew Spring had come at
last.</p>

<p>They saw a bluebird up in a tree not far
away, and they remembered what Mr. Rabbit's
poem had said about following him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
over hill and hollow; so they went along in
that direction, talking and whistling and
singing, because they felt so good in the fresh
morning sunlight.</p>

<p>And Mr. Bluebird hopped and whistled
and flew along ahead, until, by and by, they
came to where Mr. Fox lived.</p>

<p>"Where are you fellows going so early?"
called Mr. Fox.</p>

<p>"We're following Spring around the
world," called back Mr. Crow; and then
they told him all that Mr. Dog had said.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Fox looked very wise, for he
didn't know if Mr. Dog was playing a trick
on them, or if it were really true that the
world was round and he hadn't heard of it.
Anyway, he wasn't going to let on, so he
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/gs27.png" width="400" height="352" alt="SET OUT IN HIGH SPIRITS" title="" />
<span class="caption">SET OUT IN HIGH SPIRITS</span>
</div>

<p>"Why, of course! I knew that all the
time. You just keep right on until you come
to that big elm over yonder, and turn to
the right. Anybody over there can show
you the way." Then Mr. Fox coughed and
went back into the house, but he made up his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
mind he wouldn't laugh until he had seen
Mr. Dog and was sure it was all a joke.
And the Hollow Tree people kept on to the
elm tree, and, sure enough, there was Mr.
Bluebird, hopping and whistling and flying
on ahead, for he'd been listening to what
Mr. Fox had told them.</p>

<p>So they hurried right along after him till
they came to Mr. Wolf's place. Mr. Wolf
was looking out of his door as they came by.</p>

<p>"Hello, you early birds!" he called.
"Whose hen roost you been after?"</p>

<p>Then they told him they weren't thinking
of such things as that on a beautiful morning
like this, but that they were following
Spring around the world. And they told
him all that Mr. Man had said to Mr. Dog,
and what Mr. Fox had said, and about Jack
Rabbit's poem. Mr. Wolf thought he'd better
be wise, too, until he found out just how
things were, so he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sure enough! That's a good plan. I'd
go along if I had time. I know the way
well. You just keep on till you come to that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
creek yonder, then cross and turn to the
right, and after that any one can show you
the way."</p>

<p>So away went the Hollow Tree people,
and when they got to the creek, and crossed,
and turned to the right, there was the bluebird
again, hopping and whistling and dancing
on ahead, just in the direction that Mr.
Wolf had said to go. Then, pretty soon,
Mr. 'Possum said he was hungry, so they
sat down on some moss and ate their lunch,
and Mr. Bluebird came up close and sang
to them till Mr. 'Possum went to sleep in
the sun and took a little nap, while the
'Coon and the Crow put what was left back
into the basket and got ready to go. Then
Mr. 'Possum woke up and said he was sure
they must be nearly around the world, for
he'd just had a dream about catching a
chicken with four legs and two heads, and
he knew that must mean something good.
So then they went on and the bluebird went
ahead, until they came to a fine, big cave,
where Mr. Bear lived.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, Mr. Bear is very big and wise&mdash;at
least he thinks he is&mdash;and he knew right
away that Mr. Dog was just playing a joke
on them, or at least he thought he did, so
he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, well! I supposed you fellows knew
all that long ago. You don't mean to say,
do you, that this is really your first time
round? Why, I go round the world every
spring and fall, and buy most of my things
on the other side. You just follow this path
till you come to a big black rock, and then
turn to the right and keep straight ahead.
You can't miss the way."</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;FOLLOW THIS PATH TILL YOU COME TO A BIG BLACK ROCK,&quot; SAID MR. BEAR</span>
</div>

<p>Then Mr. Bear went back in his cave,
and laid down and rolled over and laughed
to think what a big joke everybody was
playing on the Hollow Tree people. But
the Hollow Tree people kept right on, for
they saw Mr. Bluebird still whistling and
dancing on ahead; and by and by they came
to the big black rock that Mr. Bear had
mentioned, and turned to the right again
as he had told them to do. Then they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
walked and walked, and Mr. Bluebird hopped
and skipped and whistled, until at last, just
as they were all getting very tired and it
was 'most night, they came to a big hollow
tree in a deep woods; and Mr. 'Possum
looked up and says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why," he says, "this tree looks a good
deal like our tree!"</p>

<p>And Mr. 'Coon, he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, it's just like our tree!"</p>

<p>And Mr. Crow, he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, it <i>is</i> our tree!" for of course they'd
turned to the right three times, which
brought them right back where they started
from, though they did not know it.</p>

<p>So then all at once they commenced to
laugh and shout:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We've done it! We've done it!</p>

"We've followed Spring around the world,<br />

<p>And the bluebird up in the branches whistled

Rabbit and Mr. Dog came over pretty soon
to see if they'd got home yet. And of course
Mr. Rabbit was proud about the way his
poem had turned out; and Mr. Dog he was
proud, too, on Mr. Man's account. Then
they all had a big supper, to celebrate, and
by and by Mr. Rabbit and Mr. Dog went
away arm in arm, singing Mr. Rabbit's poem
to the moon; while the 'Coon and 'Possum
and the Old Black Crow went to bed happy
because they had followed Spring clear
around the world, and hadn't got lost or
tumbled off into the sky, but were home
again safe and sound in the Hollow Tree.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
